	<p>
		This is my second cardboard castle to build for my kids. 
		The first castle I built was a hit, but after having another child it was time to expand. 
		This castle contains a Main Room, Middle Room and a Tower Room inviting more guests to fit inside. 
		I got an email from IKEA about getting more pictures for the popular 
		<a href='/cardboard-castle-from-boxes-fun'>Building a Cardboard Castle #1</a> 
		and sadly that castle didn't survive 
		our latest move to Austin. 
		So I offered to build a new castle which is to be featured in an \"Up Cycling\" book for IKEA France.
	</p>
	<p>
		I built a lot of \"forts\" when I was a kid from boxes, baskets, couch pillows, blankets or anything I could get my hands on. 
		Most children love building \"forts\" and playing inside them. 
		Whether they are hiding, playing pretend, or just cozying up and reading books, 
		a fort is a perfect little space for a small children to feel secure in a big world.
	</p>

	<p>
		Building this castle of course is a great bonding experience. The kids love participating in the construction. 
		Just be extra careful with the hot glue and razors, which I had to supervise at all times.
