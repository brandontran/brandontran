		My mom bought me my first acoustic guitar when I was eight years old. 
		I picked it up, and haven't put it down since. Playing music seemed to come natural to me. 
		I learned to play three songs the very first day she gave me my guitar. 
		My favorite of three was the \"Nestle Chocolate Chip Morsels\"â€‹ jingle. 
		Though it was only a short tune, it sparked my attention and helped me 
		love the craft that I was eagerly learning.

		Playing music continues to be one of my past time hobbies. 
		I have gained a substantial amount of knowledge through the years. 
		I have played and performed with various groups. 
		In 2009, I started creating cover videos for my personal YouTube channel. 
		You can check those out by visiting my channel:

		These days I mostly enjoy after work Jam sessions with a few of my musically talented colleagues. 
		In turn, I relish the times singing and playing children's songs such as \"The Wheels on the Bus\" with my two little kids.
