	<p>
		I'm a creative technologist web engineer, musician and creator passionate about building innovative products and bringing new ideas to life.
		I am an expert with 20+ years of experience in the latest full stack development techniques, technologies and responsive design.
		Specialties and experience: Javascript, CSS3, HTML5, Python, Php, Sass.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		My passion for all things web started in the fall of 1997, when I was elected treasurer of the Student Government Association at Louisiana State University in Alexandria (LSUA). 
		The internet was still in its' infancy and the LSUA SGA didn't have a website yet. So I volunteered to build them a website, my first website, and haven't stopped.
	</p>
	<p>Since then I have been innovating on the web. Starting with the 
		&ldquo;dot com boom&rdquo; in the late 1990s and then through all of its ups and downs I have successfully 
		navigated and adopted to the changing web by always pivoting and using the latest technologies and best practices available to date.
		After my first website success, followed many more. 
		Within a couple of years my popular website creations with high traffic ratings were noticed by eUniverse, Inc. 
		I worked for &ldquo;eUni&rdquo; from 2001 &ndash; 2002 managing client facing websites that Nielsen Netratings ranked in the top 15 most visited web properties in the United States at the time. 
		I designed multiples projects, innovative content delivery systems, managed content creation teams, and maintained several websites.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2002 I founded INT Marketing, Inc. to contribute to my local community by developing and marketing local businesses. 
		I continued to work independently or as remote contractor for various development projects for the next 9 years.
	</p>
	<p>
		My focus shifted in 2009. 
		I began working remote but more exclusively with a team of the leading developers and designers at DigiSynd in Los Angeles, 
		CA developing facebook applications for Disney, ABC, and ESPN. 
		During this time I created 50+ plus facebook applications. Including a prototype of an app using the Facebook Like button before it was announced.
	</p>
	<p>
		In January 2012, I moved to Los Angeles and started working for Disney Interactive full time. 
		I built applications for multiple innovation projects, activities and websites, including mobile web application development, 
		both Android and iOS applications.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2013 I became manager of engineering for the Disney Interactive Labs team and December 2015 we launched a major product DisneyLife 
		which is one of the most challenging products I have ever been a part of. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I&rsquo;m continuing to work on DisneyLife today and each day I remind myself how lucky I am to be part of something that so many people enjoy as well as getting to 
		work with so many talented and creative people. 
		There are always challenges in any project and I&rsquo;m all about staying focused through them so that the goals are achieved.
	</p>	
	<p>
		I am an advocate for keeping things simple. &ldquo;Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.&rdquo; &ndash; Leonardo da Vinci.
