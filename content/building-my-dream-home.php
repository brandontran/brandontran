		Building a large luxury home with a gorgeous mountain view in Asheville, NC. designed and constructed by Brandon and Wendy Tran. 
		We had a lot of fun creating it and look forward to building another similar project in the near future!

		In 2005, I decided to move to an area where the scenery was beautiful and inspiring with the goal of building a dream home. 
		Well... I am quite spontaneous at times, so Wendy and I packed the bags, hopped in our 2 automobiles and off we went to Asheville, North Carolina, 
		which is a hot spot we had visited in the past. It's a nice little city in the blue ridge mountains with great people, 
		fun culture, and amazing mountain views.

		In December 2005 We moved into a small 2 bedroom apartment and began looking for the perfect land to build on. 
		We soon found a great lot and began construction on this dream house in July of 2005. 
		To make a long story short, there were good times, and there were stressful times. 
		Not because of the process of building a house, yet the size and magnitude of this house. 
		This home project is right at 6,000 sq. feet, which to me, this is the size of 3 average homes. 
		So the project felt like I was building 3 houses at once. 
		The project involved many different factors I was not used to when building a house. 
		A steep mountain slope, high labor and material cost, and harsh harsh weather during the winter months. 
		In 2005 this was the real estate boom peak in most of the United States and I think that was one of the factors of costs. 
		So during the next 2 years, we would work day in, day out on this project, making it the most perfect home you could ever imagine.
