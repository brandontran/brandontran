		The Build-A-Jeep app is now live! Being an avid Jeep fan, currently I own a Jeep Liberty. 
		In the near future I hope to upgrade to a customized Wrangler. 
		After shopping around, I was curious how my new dream ride would look with custom wheels, a lift kit, my favorite color, tint, etc. 
		However, I couldn't find an app to make my dream Jeep into a virtual reality.
	</p>

	<h3>Boom! then it hit me!</h3>

	<p>
		If you can't find it, why not make it! 
		I decided to design an app to build my virtual Jeep myself. 
		Additionally, I thought other Jeep-obsessed fans would value the effort too. 
		So, I prototyped and built the Build-A-Jeep app over a few weekends. 
		The app simply allows you to choose some custom features and get a virtual look at all your 
		options before going out and spending your hard earned cash.
