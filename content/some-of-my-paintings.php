	<p>
		Over the years I have explored various modalities in which I could express my creativity. 
		After living abroad in my profoundly early twenties, I developed a deep appreciation for the Impressionist in the museums I visited across Europe. 
		More specifically, works by Claude Monet, Renoir and Van Gogh.
	</p>
	<p>
		If asked, I would have to respond that oil is my medium of choice and most of my pieces are reproduction concepts. 
		However, you can see my technique is still very different in many ways from the great Impressionists that have influenced me over the years.
