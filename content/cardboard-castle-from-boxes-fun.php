	<p>
		When I was a child I would build \"forts\" out of boxes, baskets, couch pillows, blankets, anything I could get my hands on. 
		As I grew, I found less and less use for these strongholds as they would not shield me from the adult world. Then, I had kids.
	</p>

	<p>
		Most children love building \"forts\" and my son is no exception. 
		Whether for hiding, playing pretend, camping or just cozying up and reading books, 
		a fort is a perfect little space for a small kid to feel secure in a big world.
	</p>

	<p>
		As a hands-on dad, I decided to take \"fort\" building to the next level with my little guy. 
		Thus began our cardboard castle. We built a more permanent structure out of cardboard. 
		Spending a couple of evenings creating this cardboard castle together proved a great bonding experience and he loves it! 
		It's his go-to spot for a little quiet time.
